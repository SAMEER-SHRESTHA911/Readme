## About ℹ️

**`The Dorm Den`** is a Hostel Web Portal implemented in `MERN stack` by [Bikrant Bidari](https://github.com/bikrantbdr), [Sudeep Kaucha](https://github.com/Sudeep-K), [Sameer Shrestha](https://github.com/SAMEER-SHRESTHA911) and [Arahanta Pokhrel](https://github.com/arahanta). While creating the project, we learnt about `Event Listeners in React`, `React State`, `Conditional Rendering in React`, `React Hooks(useEffect,useState)`, `React Routers`, `Styled components`, etc. A user can search for hostels as per his/her requirement and a hostel owner can showcase his/her hostel. After creating the project, _Frontend was deployed to `Netlify`and _Backend was deployed to `Render`.
